 <h2>The Life of a Tiger</h2>
 <p>Tigers live a long life. In the wild, they live for around 10-15 years in the wild. In capitivity, tigers
   live for around 20-25 years. There are many factors that impact a tiger's life.</p>
 
 <b>Habitat</b>
 <p>Tigers require large territories with adequate prey and water sources. Habitat loss and fragmentation
  due to human activities, such as deforestation and urbanization, can significantly impact their survival.</p>
  
<b>Food Availability</b>  
<p>As apex predators, tigers rely on a stable population of prey animals, such as deer, wild boar,
and other large mammals. A decline in prey populations can lead to malnutrition and reduced reproductive success.</p>

<b>Human-Wildlife Conflict</b>
<p>Tigers often come into conflict with humans, especially when their natural habitats overlap
  with human settlements. This can result in retaliatory killings, poaching, and loss of life for both
  tigers and humans.</p>

<b>Poaching and Illegal Trade</b>
<p>Tigers are poached for their skins, bones, and other body parts, which are highly valued in illegal wildlife trade.
Poaching poses a significant threat to their populations.</p>

<b>Genetic Diversity</b>
<p>Small and isolated tiger populations can suffer from inbreeding, leading to reduced genetic
diversity and increased susceptibility to diseases and genetic disorders.</p>

<b>Conservation Efforts</b>
<p>Effective conservation programs, including anti-poaching measures, habitat restoration,
and wildlife corridors, play a crucial role in protecting tigers and ensuring their long-term survival.</p>

<b>Climate Change</b>
<p>Changes in climate can affect tiger habitats and prey availability, leading to shifts in tiger
populations and distribution.</p>

<p>Now that we have accounted the factors, let's dive into the stages of a tiger's life.</p>

<h3>Birth - First 6 Months</h3>

<b>Birth</b>
<p>Tiger cubs are born blind and helpless, usually in a litter of two to four.</p>

<b>First Few Weeks</b>
<p>Cubs start to open their eyes after about 6-12 days.</p>

<b>Learning to Walk</b>
<p>By the age of six weeks, tiger cubs begin to walk and explore their surroundings.</p>

<b>Weaning</b>
<p>Cubs start to eat solid food and are weaned off their mother's milk by six months.</p>

<h3>First 6 Months - 2 Years</h3>

<b>Hunting Lessons</b>
<p>Cubs learn essential hunting skills from their mother.</p>

<b>Strength Development</b>
<p>Cubs continue to grow and develop strength.</p>

<b>Independence</b>
<p>Around the age of 1.5 to 2 years, cubs become more independent but may still stay with their mother.</p>

<h3>2 Years - 3 Years</h3>

<b>Leaving Home</b>
<p>Around the age of 2.5 years, young tigers leave their mother to establish their own territories.</p>

<b>Establishing the Territory</b>
<p>They spend time marking and defending their territory.</p>

<h3>3 Years - 5 Years</h3>

<b>Mating Age</b>
<p>Tigers reach sexual maturity at around 3 to 4 years.</p>

<b>Mating + Reproduction</b>
<p>Female tigers attract mates and begin the cycle anew.</p>

<h3>Adult Life</h3>

<b>Territory Defense</b>
<p>Adult tigers continue to defend their territories and hunt.</p>

<b>Reproduction</b>
<p>Adult females may have cubs every 2-3 years.</p>

<b>Longevity</b>
<p>In the wild, tigers typically live up to 10-15 years, while in captivity, they may live longer,
around 20 years.</p>

<h3>Old Age</h3>

<b>Decreased Hunting Ability</b>
<p>Older tigers may struggle with hunting and defending their territories.</p>

<b>End of Life</b>
<p>Natural causes, injuries, or conflicts can end a tiger's life in the wild.</p>
