  <h2>Physical Characteristics of Tigers</h2>
  <p>Tigers are part of the mammal family. More specifically, they are part of the <i>Felidae</i> family.
  Their scientific name is <i>Panthera tigris.</i> Tigers are large powerful creatures. They have orange bodies
  with black stripes. Did you know that each tiger's stripes are as unique as a human fingeprints? Tigers are 
  powerfully built creatures, and the largest of the big cats. They have refined sight, smell, and hearing. Tigers
  have retractable claws and large canine teeth. Their tails help them to balance carefully to make precise movements
  I have created a table below. There is information for male tigers, female tigers, and tiger cubs.</p>

<h2>Tiger Behaviour</h2>
<p>Tiger are really smart and stealthy. They are independent, solitary, and territorial creatures. Their hunting
skills are top-notch. However, tigers are also very protective. Female tigers are constantly making sure 
that their cubs are safe. As for the cubs themselves, they are extremely cute and playful. Tiger cubs often
play-fight to practise hunting. Tigers are really resilient, as they are able to easily adapt.</p>
<p>Tigers love to communicate with each other. They use a variety of vocal noises. Some examples are roars, growls,
hisses, and chuffs. Chuffs are kind of like a friendly tiger noise, since they can't purr.</p>
<p>Tigers represent power, elegance, self-reliance, and determination. They are also revered in many Asian
cultures. They are often depicted in mythology, art, and folklore.</p>
