    <h2>About Tigers</h2>
    <p>This website will talk about tigers. Tigers are majestic  creatures that are part of the <i>Felidae</i>
    family. Tigers are in the same family as lions, cheetahs, jaguars, leopards, and even house cats. Tigers have a
    large body with unique stripes. They have a large diet, and they can live pretty long lives. I won't reveal
    too much information, as this website will tell the rest.</p>

    <h2>About the Creator</h2>
  <p>Hello everyone. My name is Anvesha Mavinkurve. I am twelve years old (currently), and I got to 
  Stonebridge Public School. I learnt how to build this website at an academic program called, StudentScholars.
  I made this website to teach people about tigers, since they are my favourite animal. I also made a
  project on pandas. My goal is to enlighten people on these endangered animals in a fun, engaging way.</p>
