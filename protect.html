<h2>How to Protect Tigers</h2>

<p>We all know that in today's world, many creatures are either extinct or at least going endangered. 
Sadly, that is also the case with tigers. Tigers are even extinct in Cambodia! The main purpose of my website
is to raise awareness about the endangerment about tigers. But really, why are tigers going extinct in the
first place?</p>

<h2 class="h3">The Extinction of Tigers</h2>

<b>Habitat Loss</b>
<p>Deforestation for agriculture and infrastructure have really reduced their natural habitats.</p>

<b>Poaching and Illegal Trade</b>
<p>Tigers are hunted for their skins, bones, and other body parts, which are sold on the black market.
</p>

<b>Human-Wildlife Conflict</b>
<p>As their habitats shrink, tigers sometimes prey on livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by farmers.
When tigers attack livestock or come into contact with humans, they are often killed in retaliation.</p>

<b>Climate Change</b>
<p>Rising temperatures and environmental changes affect prey availability and disrupt ecosystems.
</p>

<h2 class="h3">How We Can Help</h2>

<b>Preserve Their Habitat</b>
<p>Tigers need vast forests to thrive. Supporting conservation efforts that protect and restore their
natural habitats is essential.
</p>

<b>Combat Poaching</b>
<p>Tigers are often hunted for their skins and body parts. Strengthening anti-poaching laws and enforcement
can help curb this threat.
</p>

<b>Spread Awareness</b>
<p>Educate others about the threats tigers face and encourage responsible wildlife tourism. Informing 
others about the plight of tigers and encouraging responsible tourism can contribute to their
protection.</p>

<b>Support Conservation Organizations</b>
<p>Groups like WWF and Project Endangered Tigers work to protect tiger habitats and combat poaching.
</p>

<p>With enough help and effort, healthy tiger populations can be restored. You can also help make a 
difference. Donate to the WWF as they are one of the most important conservation organizations in the world.</p>
