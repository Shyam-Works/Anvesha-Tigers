<h3>Strategies of Hunting</h3>
<b>Stalking</b>
<p>Using the cover of vegetation, tigers patiently stalk their prey. The stripes help them to blend in with their
background.</p>

<b>Ambushing</b>
<p>When tigers are close enough to their prey, they suddenly lunge. Tigers like to go for the back, with the element
of suprise. With one quick bite on the neck, tigers use their razor-sharp teeth and claws to finish their prey.</p>

<b>Swim Power</b>
<p>Unlike many big cats, cat are suprisingly good at swimming. There was actually a tiger who swam for 120 km! When
a water chase happens, tigers strong swimming give them an advantage.</p>

<b>Nocturnal Vision</b>
<p>Tigers have excellent night vision. This helps them to hunt in the night. Especially since most of tigers' prey 
have poor night sight.</p>

<b>Patience</b>
<p>Tigers have a lot of patience. They can wait for hours, waiting for the perfect time to strike.</p>  

<h2>Main Prey</h2>

<h3>Large Prey</h3>

<b>Large Deer</b> 
<p>Tigers like to hunt sambar deer, chital, hog deer, and barasingha.</p>

<b>Wild boar</b> 
<p>Tigers love to prey on wild boar which are plentiful in numbers.</p>

<b>Buffalo and gaur</b> 
<p>Tigers sometimes hunt these large animals.</p>

<h3>Medium-sized Prey</h3>

<b>Small Deer</b>
<p>Tigers prey on antelope, mujac, and serow.</p>

<b>Wild Goats and Sheep</b>
<p>For mountainous tigers, they often hunt goats like tahr.</p>

<h3>Small Prey</h3>

<b>Hares and Rabbits</b>
<p>Sometimes tigers hunt them because larger prey is scarce.</p>

<b>Porcupines and Pangolins</b>
<p>These are hard to hunt, but sometimes tigers prey on them.</p>

<h2>Other (Occasional) Prey</h2>

<b>Birds</b>
<p>Sometimes tigers hunt pheasants and peafowl(peacocks).</p>

<b>Fish and Reptiles</b>
<p>Since tigers can swim, they can hunt fish and caimans. They also rarely hunt snakes.</p>

<h3>More Rare Prey that Tiger Eat</h3>

<b>Cows and Buffalo</b>
<p>Tigers only turn to livestock when other prey is scarce.</p>

<b>Goats and Sheep</b>
<p>Just like buffalo, tigers rarely hunt them.</p>

<b>Carrion</b>
<p>Tigers will sometimes scavenge from other predators' kills.</p>

<b>Primates</b>
<p>Tigers will rarely prey on monkeys.</p>

<b>Rodents</b>
<p>Rodents are a last-resort prey.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that tigers barely prey on humans. Fewer than 85 people get
attacked by tigers per year.<p>
